## Data Vision

We live in a world where data resides on-premises, across one or multiple cloud platforms, and from third parties – and all of this data needs to be cataloged and governed, breaking down traditional data silos.

Data should be easily accessible to maximize the value you can derive from it.

Data analytics demands are now coming from every corner of the business – everyone is becoming a data user. Supporting all of these users seamlessly is becoming an increasingly significant challenge.

As data becomes more strategic, analytical workloads are becoming more essential, and downtime can cause severe business disruption. Many customers are running their analytics systems 24/7.

With more sensitive data such as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) being stored in analytical systems, the need for robust data security and governance solutions is more prevalent than ever.

Finally, as data analytics demands continue to grow, customers are looking for a scalable architecture to support high-performance workloads while keeping costs under control.

## Democratizing Machine Learning with Redshift ML

A **data warehouse** can be a powerful component in a modern data architecture, enabling high-performance analytics and machine learning operations across all your data.

A modern data warehouse is more than just a place to store and query data. It can:

- Store data,

- Access data where it resides, across multiple data sources,

- Use simple ingestion techniques to bring data into the warehouse,

- Scale seamlessly to support virtually unlimited concurrency,

- Abstract much of the analytical complexity for developers, analysts, and data scientists,

- Provide decoupled storage and compute with flexible pricing – you only pay for what you use,

- Deliver the best performance-to-value ratio: as analytical workloads scale, performance remains high while costs stay reasonable.

Ultimately, it's a powerful engine to help you gain real-time insights and make predictions with built-in ML capabilities.
