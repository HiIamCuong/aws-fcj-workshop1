## Definition
**Zero-ETL Integration** refers to a set of integration methods that eliminate or minimize the need to build traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data processes. ETL is the process of combining, cleaning, and standardizing data from various sources to make it ready for analytical, AI, and ML workloads. Traditional ETL processes are time-consuming and complex to develop, maintain, and scale. Instead, zero-ETL integration facilitates point-to-point data movement without the need to build ETL pipelines. Zero-ETL can also enable cross-system querying without physically moving data.

## Benefits of Zero-ETL Integration
- Reduces the complexity of systems that require ETL.
- Lowers overhead costs associated with ETL processes.
- Eliminates delays in analytics, AI, and ML workloads.
- Increases flexibility by simplifying data architecture, reducing effort, and allowing the use of new data without processing large volumes.
- Enables faster insights, as traditional ETL processes often involve periodic batch updates, which delay data availability. Zero-ETL provides real-time or near real-time data access, ensuring fresher data for analytics, AI/ML technologies, and reportingâ€”improving the user experience.

## Applications of Zero-ETL
- Organizations that need to quickly ingest and analyze various types of data to make real-time decisions.
- Data streaming platforms and message queues transmitting real-time data from multiple sources.

Traditionally, moving data from operational and transactional databases into data warehouses and data lakes has required a complex ETL solution. Today, zero-ETL capabilities can act as a data replication tool, instantly copying data from operational databases, transactional systems, and applications into data warehouses and data lakes.
