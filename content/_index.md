# Connect and analyze all your data with zero-ETL approaches

### Overall

In this lab, we will use the zero-ETL feature of [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) to consolidate data from multiple source database clusters of [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) into Redshift data warehouses. Data in [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) can be updated from [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) clusters in near real-time.
